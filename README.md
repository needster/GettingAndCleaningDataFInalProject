# GCD Project Dataset
This file describes the various files contained within this directory, which were generated toward the completion of the final course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, which is a MOOC offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.

### Project Overview
From the project description: "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis."

In short, the goal of this project is to prepare a tidy data set from data located in various files, then perform computations on the data to create a second, smaller tidy data set. 

Formally, the project requirements are to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
