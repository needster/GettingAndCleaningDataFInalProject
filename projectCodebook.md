# Project Codebook
This file describes the format and values of the data sets for the following:
* input data used by the `run_analysis` function
* resulting tidy data set produced by the `run_analysis` function


## Input data

The following files from the Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set are used by the `run_analysis` function.
